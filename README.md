" The peony blooms . "

— ･｡ﾟ I might seem that I'm unapproachable and all but I assure you that's not the case !! I am just extremely awkward and shy but I am always willing to engage in conversations with you . I always try my best to listen, but I never know the right words to start a conversation so bare with me there ahahah... anyhoo I rarely talk unless it genuinely interests me and that I wanna be included, I always feel left out but always trying my best to not feel like that !! 

— ･｡ﾟ I have a weird way of joking sometimes so please if I offend you or weird you out or anything at all that's negative or made you feel the wrong way, please let me know <33 I always try my best to not seem offensive, sometimes I just get too excited or too energetic and I act or talk without thinking, I can't help it but I'm willing to make up for it </3

— ･｡ﾟ For every person or group I talk to, I adapt a somewhat different persona for each of them . It's not supposed to mean anything but it's just to seem normal . 

— ･｡ﾟ I tend to be quiet a lot and just "mute" at random times, not to worry though it doesn't change anything towards my relationship with you or anyone else .

— ･｡ﾟ I always love talking to my friends, whenever an opportunity shines to get to talk with them I always try to take it when I'm available and online <3 I care about every single one of my friends even if I have a hard time showing or expressing my feelings .

— ･｡ﾟ Never be afraid to vent or open up to me, I am always happy to talk to you and help you if I am able you, in ways I'm able to . Just please ask first though, boundaries of course <3 . 

— ･｡ﾟ I'm really sensitive, that's not a secret about me for most people . I tend to be upset, panic, and make a big deal out of something small like ; loud noises, schedules or plans being changed or interrupted, being talked to in a certain way . So that's one of my bad qualities I might say . 

— ･｡ﾟ I really love the night sky, the moon, the stars, the clouds.. and everything else up there. How curious.. I always feel safe when I look up at the moon .
